<!--
  Issue caused by `transformLinks` Remark plugin that ships with Docusaurus:
  `packages/docusaurus-mdx-loader/src/remark/transformLinks/index.ts`.
  By intention it ignores `*.html` files to be processed when creating asset
  links.

  TODO: Check, if only local deployment is affected. GitHub Pages may not have
    an issue here.

:::note
Due to some yet unresolved issues, links to HTML artifacts will not work.
Visit the artifacts directly in the GitHub repository instead.
