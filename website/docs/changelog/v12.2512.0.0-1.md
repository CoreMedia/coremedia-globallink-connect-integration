# GlobalLink Connect Cloud for CoreMedia Content Cloud v2512.0.0-1

Approving the GlobalLink Connect Cloud integration for CoreMedia Content Cloud
v13.2512.0.0.

## Summary :clipboard:

* **Use `catalog:` in Studio-Client**

  Changed all package dependencies to packages that are not inside the workspace
  to `catalog:`.

* **Updated Studio-Client Icons**

  Provided new icons aligned with new requirements for Studio-Client.

* **Opt-In Static Code Analysis (Maven)**

  For the Maven build process, we added the option to activate static code
  analysis with [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) and to fail the build on
  warnings. This is not active by default, but can be activated with the profile
  `gcc-strict-checks`.

  The previous profile `strict-checks` that was active by default and could
  be deactivated with `-DskipChecks` is now removed.
