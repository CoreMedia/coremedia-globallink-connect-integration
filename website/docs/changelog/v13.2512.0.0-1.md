# GlobalLink Connect Cloud for CoreMedia Content Cloud v2512.0.0-1

Approve CMCC v13.2512.0.0.

## Summary

* Adapted and approved the connector for use with CoreMedia Content Cloud
  v13.2512.0.0.
* Updated `com.translations.globallink:gcc-restclient` to version 3.1.9.
* Introduced Error Prone and NullAway checks and annotations to the code base.

## Upgrade Information :up:

### Java 21 &amp; Maven 3.9.11

Aligned with the CMCC v13.2512.0.0 update, we updated the Java version to 21 and
Maven version to 3.9.11. You may need to update your development environment
accordingly. Where applicable, we adapted the code base to be compliant with
Java 21.

### Workflow Definition

There is no need to upload the workflow definition again or to trigger
the `cm workflowconverter`.

### GCC REST Java Client

Regarding the update of the GCC REST java client API, no adaptations are
required within the given code base. You may though, need to be aware of
the changes for your custom adaptations, like if you integrated context upload.

### Static Code Analysis Checks

The Maven build profile `strict-checks` has been renamed to `gcc-strict-checks`
for clear scoping and to avoid collisions with potential other profiles that
ship with the CoreMedia Blueprint. Different to `strict-checks` the profile is
now disabled by default, as the checks not only increase build time but also
require adapting your code base to be compliant with the checks.

Where required by static code analysis checks, the code base has been adapted.

### Studio Client Adaptations

The CoreMedia GCC integration is now aligned with the changes in the Studio
Client public API that shipped with CMCC v13.2512.0.0. You may need to adapt
your custom Studio Client code base to the changes accordingly.

## Improvements :sparkles:

### Enhanced Documentation

The documentation now contains an extra hint in context of the _Redelivered_
state, how to manually upload XLIFF via Content App.

### GCC REST Java Client Update

![App: Workflow-Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflow--server-550011)

The GCC REST Java client has been updated to version 3.1.9. While no adaptations
are required within the given code base, the changes may be interesting for
your custom adaptations, like if you integrated context upload.

### Add Configuration Option for GCC REST Java Client Retries

![App: Workflow-Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflow--server-550011)

GCC REST Java Client introduced more robustness on HTTP level communication.
This includes internal retries, like when the service is unavailable. While
in general the CoreMedia GCC integration provides own means of retrying failed
operations (including fallback to user tasks, on repeated failure), you may
want to opt-in to the internal retries of the GCC REST Java Client, which can be
configured with the new configuration properties
`maxRetriesOnServiceUnavailable` and `maxRetriesOnRequestErrors`.

For easier maintenance, the configuration of `GCConfig` has been extracted into
a separate class `GCConfigUtil` (and removed from `DefaultGCExchangeFactory`).

### Added Localization for XLIFF Import Failures

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

To better assist editors working on workflows where the XLIFF import may fail,
we added a localized error message that is shown in the UI when the import
fails. This includes messages for generally broken XML reported as
`INVALID_XLIFF` as well as localized strings that exceed the maximum allowed
length in the content type model, which is reported as `STRING_TOO_LONG`.

### Updated Icons to New Icon Design

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

Aligned the GlobalLink workflow icons with the updated icon design that ships
with CMCC v13.2512.0.0.
See the release note for CMS-28088 for reference.

### Removed Invalid ExtJS Reference

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

Package `@coremedia-labs/studio-client.ext.gcc-studio-client` has been
renamed to `@coremedia-labs/studio-client.gcc-studio-client` and the invalid
reference to ExtJS has been removed.

### NodeJS and PNPM Updates

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

Aligned with the CMCC v13.2512.0.0 update, we updated NodeJS to version 24.x and
PNPM to version 10.24.x.
See the release note for CMS-28547 for reference.

### Use PNPM Catalog Protocol

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

Aligned with the CMCC v13.2512.0.0 update, we changed all package dependencies
to packages that are not inside the workspace to `catalog:`.
See the release notee for CMC-27980 for reference.

### Adapted ESLint Configuration

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

Aligned with the CMCC v13.2512.0.0 update, we adapted the ESLint configuration
to refer to the new independently released ESLint configuration. Replaced
`.eslintrc.js` with `eslint.config.js`.
See the release note for CMS-27991 for reference.

### Adapted to Studio Client Public API Changes

![App: Studio-Client](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--client-0000ff)

Aligned with the CMCC v13.2512.0.0 update, we adapted the code base to the
changes in the Studio Client public API. This includes:

* Changing reference of `WorkflowLocalization` to `WorkflowLocalizationConfig`.

### Introduced Error Prone and NullAway Checks and Annotations

![App: Studio-Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/studio--server-005511)
![App: Workflow-Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/workflow--server-550011)

To further improve support for JSpecify nullability annotations, build-time
nullability checks based on the Error Prone static code analysis tool and the
NullAway plugin have been introduced. These checks are not active by default,
but can be activated with the Maven profile `gcc-strict-checks`. When activated,
the build will fail if any warnings are reported by the checks. To fix reported
warnings, you may need to adapt your code base and add nullability annotations
where required.

The old profile `strict-checks` that was active by default and could be
deactivated with `-DskipChecks` is now removed, as we want to make the use of
static code analysis checks an explicit decision.

**Code Adaptations:** Note that as we enabled the full ruleset of Error Prone
checks, there were some code adaptations required to fix warnings reported by
the checks. The most common fixes were:

* Extend nullability annotations especially in context of generics, where
  required by NullAway to be able to verify null-safety.
* Reducing the visibility of methods and fields when inconsistent with the
  class visibility.
* Removed (or explicitly declared) system dependent dependencies, such as the
  default ZoneId.
* Better ensured immutability to enumerations and records.
* Added Error Prone annotations where requested like:
  * `@Immutable`
  * `@FormatMethod` and `@FormatString` for format strings and their parameters.

**Required New API:** The `Settings` record field `properties` had an
imbalanced nullability annotation for read and write access (allowing null
for write access but not for read access, as null values got removed at
construction time).

To fix this, we introduced a new API `Settings.ofSanitized()` that in its
signature allows null values for the `properties` field, but removes them at
construction time.

> **Suppress Warnings:** If you want to suppress warnings reported by the
> checks, you can use the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation with the appropriate
> check name, like `@SuppressWarnings("NullAway")` to suppress NullAway warnings
> for a specific method or class.

The now irrelevant script `check-jspecify-dev.sh` has been removed.

## Minor Changes :broom:

### Screenshots in Documentation

Screenshots in the documentation have been updated to reflect the new icons and
UI changes.

### Hardened Cancelation Test in DefaultGCExchangeFacadeContractTest

We adapted our recommended test to provide base confidence that the
CoreMedia GCC integration is aligned with the GCC REST Java Client regarding
the cancelation test due to observed flakiness in the test by adding some
grace period before triggering the cancelation.

### Extended Mock Scenarios for XLIFF Import Failures

To better test handling of invalid XLIFF, new test scenarios have been added:

* `translation-does-not-exist`: A target content is not available anymore to
  receive the translation update.
* `translate-empty-transunit-target`: The XLIFF contains an empty target
  element, while the source element was not (and thus, we expect a translation).
* `translate-invalid-content-id`: The XLIFF contains a content ID that cannot
  be parsed.
* `translate-string-too-long`: The XLIFF contains a translation for a string
  that exceeds the maximum allowed length in the content type model.
  (Existed before, but was undocumented.)

### Adapted Main README.md

* Updated badges to better reflect the current state and added a prominent
  link to the documentation in the header section.
* Fixed a broken link in the _CoreMedia Labs_ section.

### Adapted .gitignore

* Added exclusion for `*.args` files, which are generated by the Error Prone
  static code analysis checks.

## Behind the Scenes :gear:

As this is an open source project, meant to be adapted and extended by our
customers, it is important that you also know about changes that do not directly
affect the functionality but are visible in the code base and may affect your
custom adaptations.

### Dependabot Adaptations

The dependabot configuration has been adapted, to ignore updates for `ajv` in
version 6.x to not break the transitive dependency `file-loader` that is used
by Docusaurus.

Note, that we consider this exception tolerable, as Docusauris is only used
at build time to create static HTML pages to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Documented Upgrade Exceptions

For the `website/` module, exceptions are documented in `.npmrc` and
`DEPENDENCY_OVERRIDES.md`, so that they can easily be tracked and maintained.

A new script `validate:overrides` has been added to validate that all exceptions
are still relevant.

### GitHub Workflow: pages-deploy.xml

* Hardened GitHub pages deployment, so that it is always only applied from
  the `main` branch and not from any other branches or pull requests.
* Updated NodeJS to 24.x
* Updated PNPM to 10.24.x
* Updated GitHub actions to the latest versions.

### GitHub Workflow: pages-test-deploy.xml

* Updated NodeJS to 24.x
* Updated PNPM to 10.24.x
* Updated GitHub actions to the latest versions.

### GitHub Workflow: validate-pom-parent-relative-path.yml

* Updated GitHub actions to the latest versions.
