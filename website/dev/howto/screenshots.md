# Updating and Adding Screenshots

This document is a recommendation how to update or add screenshots to the
documentation. It is not a strict guideline, but a suggestion how to keep the
documentation consistent and easy to maintain.

First, there will be some general recommendation, while next, you will see
recommended steps to reach a given UI state per corresponding screenshot.

## General Recommendations

### Common Screenshot Size

**TL;DR**: Use device terminal emulation with viewport size 1920x1080.

To best align the sizes of the screenshots, it is recommended to use the
browser's developer tools to set the viewport size to a common value. This
ensures that the screenshots have a similar size and are easier to compare.

The following steps are recommended to create a screenshot:

1. Open the page in the browser.
2. Open the development tools (F12).
3. Toggle the device terminal emulation (Ctrl+Shift+M).
4. Set the viewport size to a common value (e.g., 1280x800).

To take the screenshot, you may also use the development tools of the browser:

1. Open the development tools (F12).
2. Select the `<body>` element.
3. Right-click the element and select "Capture node screenshot".

For dynamic elements it may be easier just to use tools such as
[Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/), for example.

### GlobalLink Configuration

_Translation Settings_ to be adapted for screenshot scenarios to be found at

* `/Settings/Options/Settings/Translation Services/GlobalLink`

It is recommended to add this to your bookmarks while working on the
screenshots.

All the steps below assume, that you have set the GlobalLink connection type
to `mock`. This is recommended as some relevant states cannot be reached in
the GlobalLink backend, or are hard to reach.

Also, you should align the delays and retry counts to the following values
(excerpt of the Struct property):

```yaml
globalLink:
  # String
  type: mock
  # Boolean; changed within manual test steps
  isSendSubmitter: false
  # String
  sendTranslationRequestRetryDelay: 1m
  # String
  sendTranslationRequestEarlyRetryDelay: 1m
  # String
  downloadTranslationRetryDelay: 1m
  # String
  cancelTranslationRetryDelay: 1m
  # Integer; change existing value
  retryCommunicationErrors: 1
  # Mock settings to possibly adapt.
  mock:
    # ...
```

### User

Unless specified otherwise, use the user `Rick C` to log in to CoreMedia Studio.

### Sites

* **Preferred Site**: Chef Corp. (`en-US`) (should be the default site for Rick C)
* **Target Site**: Chef Corp. (`de-DE`)

The description assumes, that you have adapted the `de-DE` site by adding:

* **Site Manager Groups**: For `de-DE`, add `manager-c-en-US`

This allows taking screenshots without the need to switch users/sessions.

### Content

While not all screenshots have to be taken with the same content, it is
recommended to reuse content where possible. If you set up the content as
described here, you can reuse it for the screenshots described in this document.

* Create a picture document named _Press Release Image_ with the following
  image:

  ![Press Release Image](./img/press-release.jpg)

* Create a new article named _Press Release_. Add the picture to
  _Pictures and Other Media_.

* As "Article Text" (`en-US`) use (as a suggestion; generated by GitHub
  Copilot):

  > We are excited to announce the release of the new CoreMedia GlobalLink
  > connector! This update brings a host of shiny new features designed to
  > enhance your translation workflow, including improved integration with
  > GlobalLink, faster processing times, and a more intuitive user interface.
  > Upgrade now to experience the best in content localization and
  > management.

* Add the content to the Chef Corp. Homepage, for example, at
  _Placement 1_.

:::tip TIP: Annoying Spellchecker
If you have a spellchecker enabled in your browser, it may highlight the
text as having spelling mistakes. To disable it, while you are in developer
tools, adjust the `<body>` element adding the attribute `spellcheck="false"`.

As an alternative, type into the console:

```javascript
document.body.spellcheck=false
```

## Screenshot Advice

**Sorting**: Screenshot advices should be sorted by the file name of the
screenshot they are referring to.

### gcc-connect-error.png

A screenshot representing an upload communication error in the GlobalLink
connector.

1. **Translation Settings:** Set `mock.scenario` to `gcc-outage-on-upload`.
2. **Workflow:**
   * Start a translation workflow for the article _Press Release_ to `de-DE`.
   * As workflow name choose _Press Release with GlobalLink_.
3. **Workflow App:** From the "In localization" badge, for example, open the
   workflow within the Workflow App.
4. **Accept User Task:** As soon as available, accept the user task named
   _Upload error_.
5. **Next Step:** Click the _Next Step_ button to show the corresponding
   dialog, that will also contain the error message.

**Cleanup**: Consider selecting _Rollback_ to end the workflow.

### gcc-redelivered.png

A screenshot representing a redelivered submission state in the GlobalLink
connector.

1. **Translation Settings:**
   * Set `mock.scenario` to `submission-redelivered`.
2. **Workflow:**
   * Start a translation workflow for the article _Press Release_ to `de-DE`.
   * As workflow name choose _Press Release with GlobalLink_.
3. **Workflow App:** From the "In localization" badge, for example, open the
   workflow within the Workflow App.
4. **Accept User Task:** As soon as available, accept the user task named
   _Review translation (Redelivered)_.

**Cleanup**: _Skip cleanup, if you want to continue with the next screenshot
scenario_. Otherwise, consider accepting the user task and selecting _Rollback_
to end the workflow.

### gcc-redelivered-upload-xliff.png

A screenshot representing a typical process during redelivered submission
handling, which is to manually upload the XLIFF file received from the
translation agency after a redelivery.

**Screenshot Tool Recommended**: As we are about to screenshot an element
(a tooltip) that will disappear on the mouseout event, it is recommended to use
an external screenshot tool, to trigger the screenshot via a hotkey. If
possible, adjust your screenshot tool to also capture the mouse cursor.

1. Prepare the redelivery scenario as described in the previous screenshot
   advice.
2. **Workflow App:** To have just any XLIFF file at hand, you can click on
   _Issue Details_ » _Click to download_ to get a ZIP file containing the XLIFF.
   Unpack the ZIP and keep the XLIFF file for the next step.
3. **Content App:**
  * Minimize the preview before taking the screenshot. The currently opened
    document will appear as background to the start workflow window.
  * Close all tabs despite the _Press Release_ (`en-US`, active tab).
  * Open the workflow in the sidebar, thus, click on "Show Workflow" button
    within the "In Localization" badge.
  * Click on _Upload_ to open the upload dialog and select the XLIFF extracted
    in the previous step as a file to upload.
  * Move the upload dialog closer to the _Upload_ button, so that the main
    focus of the screenshot is on the connection between the button and the
    dialog.
  * Hover the mouse cursor over the _Upload_ button to show the tooltip for 
    that button.

**Cleanup**: Consider selecting _Rollback_ to end the workflow.

### gcc-running.png

A screenshot representing the running workflow when opened in the Workflow App.

1. **Translation Settings:** Ensure, that no scenario is selected.
2. **Workflow:**
   * Start a translation workflow for the article _Press Release_ to `de-DE`.
   * Ensure, that the article _Press Release_ is added as dependent content.
   * As workflow name choose _Press Release with GlobalLink_.
3. **Workflow App:** From the "In localization" badge, for example, open the
   workflow within the Workflow App.
4. **Status:** To have an alike screenshot over versions, wait for the field
   _Status_ to switch to "Delivered".
5. **Contents:** Expand the _Contents_ section to show the content to be
   translated.

**Cleanup**: Consider accepting the user task and selecting _Rollback_ to end
the workflow.

### gcc-select-type.png

A screenshot that shows the Start Translation Workflow Window while selecting
the localization workflow type.

**Screenshot Tool Recommended**: As we are about to screenshot an element
(the dropdown) that will close on the blur event, it is recommended to use an
external screenshot tool, to trigger the screenshot via a hotkey. If possible,
adjust your screenshot tool to also capture the mouse cursor.

1. **Translation Settings:** Ensure, that no scenario is selected.
2. **Content App:**
   * Minimize the preview before taking the screenshot. The currently opened
     document will appear as background to the start workflow window.
   * Close all tabs despite the _Press Release_ (background tab) and the
     homepage (active tab).
3. **Workflow:**
   * Trigger start of a translation workflow for the homepage to `de-DE`.
   * Select _Translation with GlobalLink_ as workflow type.
   * As workflow name choose _Press Release with GlobalLink_.
   * Open the _Workflow Type_ selection combo.
   * Hover the mouse cursor over the _Translation with GlobalLink_ option.

**Cleanup:** Just don't start the workflow, but cancel the dialog.

### gcc-settings.png

A screenshot that gives an impression on the `GlobalLink` settings document
and its location.

1. **Translation Settings**: We need a little trick not to break our other
   screenshot scenarios, but also only provide a minimal set of settings
   relevant for in-production use. Just create a copy of `GlobalLink` settings
   document in the home-folder of Rick C, for example. Remove all settings
   despite:
   * `url`
   * `key`
2. **Content App**:
   * Open your copied settings document.
   * Close the preview.
   * Open the library view by clicking on the content path in the _System_ tab
     of the original `GlobalLink` settings document.
   * Dock the library to the right side.
   * Move the splitters around, so that you get the best view on relevant
     parts of the settings document as well as in the library. Also, consider
     hiding irrelevant columns in the library.
   * Close all other tabs but that for the "mocked" settings document.

### gcc-start-wf.png

A screenshot that provides a hint on how to start a translation workflow.

**UX Hint**: Depending on updates in context of the workflow UI, new concepts
for starting translation workflows may be introduced and preferred as
"ease of use" pattern. Please consider this when updating the screenshot.

**Screenshot Tool Recommended**: As we are about to screenshot an element
(the dropdown) that will close on the blur event, it is recommended to use an
external screenshot tool, to trigger the screenshot via a hotkey. If possible,
adjust your screenshot tool to also capture the mouse cursor.

1. **Content App:**
   * Close all tabs despite the _Press Release_ (background tab) and the
     homepage (active tab).
   * Minimize the preview before taking the screenshot. The currently opened
     document will appear as background to the start workflow window.
2. **Start Workflow Trigger**: Open the _Locale Switcher_. If your screenshot
   tool supports capturing the mouse cursor hover it above "Start localization".

**Cleanup:** Just don't start the workflow, but close the dialog.

### gcc-success.png

A screenshot that shows the task "Review Translation" in the Content App along
with the differencing view.

1. **Translation Settings:** Ensure, that no scenario is selected.
2. **Content:**
    * Process a first translation workflow for the article to `de-DE`.

      You may just use any translation workflow. Consider using the standard
      _Translation_ workflow that ships with CoreMedia Blueprint.

    * Update the content to mark "CoreMedia GlobalLink connector" as bold.
3. **Workflow:**
   * Start a translation workflow for _Press Relese_ article to `de-DE`.
   * As workflow name choose _Update Press Release_.
4. **Content App:**
   * Close all other tabs despite the _Press Relese_ article.
   * Open the workflow in the sidebar (for example, click on "Show Workflow"
     button within the "In Localization" badge)
   * Accept the user task.
   * Double-click on the _Press Relese_ article in the workflow's content set
     to open the differencing view.
   * Change the pseudo-translated title just to _Press Relese_.
   * Override the pseudo-translated result with this suggested translation:

     > Wir freuen uns, die Veröffentlichung des neuen **CoreMedia GlobalLink
     > Connectors** bekannt geben zu können! Dieses Update bietet eine Vielzahl
     > neuer Funktionen, die Ihren Übersetzungs-Workflow verbessern, darunter
     > eine verbesserte Integration mit GlobalLink, schnellere
     > Verarbeitungszeiten und eine intuitivere Benutzeroberfläche. Holen Sie
     > sich jetzt das Upgrade und erleben Sie das Beste in Sachen
     > Inhaltslokalisierung und -verwaltung.

   * Check-in the modified content.
   * Move the separators around to have a good view on the overall scenario.

**Cleanup**: Consider accepting the user task and selecting _Rollback_ to end
the workflow.
