# Create GitHub Release

* Create a GitHub release from the tag, and provide an excerpt of the
  applied changes (while details are left to the description within the
  website's changelog).

  Consider applying a similar (or the same) pattern as for previous releases.

* Review GitHub issues and possibly adjust state.
