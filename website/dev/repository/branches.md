* **main:** The primary development branch where ongoing work for future
  releases takes place. All new feature development and pull requests should
  target this branch. New major release branches (e.g., `maintenance/2406.x`,
  `maintenance/2412.x`) are created from `main` when a new major version of the
  underlying platform needs to be prepared.

* **maintenance/MMMM.x:** Major Version specific release branches created for
  each major/ version of the underlying platform. It is created as soon as the
  approval for the next major version starts.

  Approvals for minor version within the same major version (e.g., `2406.1`,
  `2406.2`) are created from the respective `maintenance/MMMM.x` branch. These
  branches receive approval-specific changes, dependency updates, and API
  adaptations.

  Release tags are always only applied to maintenance branches.

  Bug fix releases (in context of issues within this integration) typically
  increase the last digit of the tag (e.g., `v2406.0.0-2`, `v2406.0.0-3`).

* **gh-pages:** An orphaned branch used to publish GitHub Pages website. For
  details and how it interacts with the release/approval process, see the
  [Documentation section](./documentation.md).

:::note NOTE: Previous Branch Model
Until approval of 2406.1.0 and 2412.0.0 we stick to a Git-Flow process. Starting
with 2406.2.0 in August 2025, we changed to this new branching model. That is
why the actual branches may not match the graph above.
:::

:::info INFO: Option to Archive Branches
The CoreMedia GlobalLink Connect Integration is only maintained for CMCC
versions in standard support.

Assuming that all maintenance branches always end with a commit that is tagged,
it is recommended to just delete maintenance branches as soon as they are not
supported anymore. This also includes any version that reaches extended support.

These maintenance branches can later be restored easily, if required based on
the last release/approval tag.
