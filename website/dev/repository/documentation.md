# Documentation

This project uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for generating and maintaining versioned documentation. Docusaurus is a modern static website generator that's particularly well-suited for technical documentation with features like versioning, internationalization, and search.

## Documentation Workflow

The following diagram shows how documentation versions are managed and deployed:

gitGraph:
  commit id: "ongoing dev"
  commit id: "doc snapshot 2406.x"
  commit tag: "v2406.0.0-1"
  branch release/2406.0
  branch gh-pages
  checkout gh-pages
  commit id: "deploy 2406.x docs"
  checkout main
  commit id: "development"
  commit id: "doc snapshot 2412.x"
  commit tag: "v2412.0.0-1"
  branch release/2412.0
  checkout gh-pages
  commit id: "deploy 2412.x docs"
  checkout main
  commit id: "doc fixes"
  checkout gh-pages
  commit id: "update docs"
  checkout main
  commit id: "doc snapshot 2506.x"
  commit tag: "v2506.0.0-1"
  branch release/2506.0
  checkout gh-pages
  commit id: "deploy 2506.x docs"
  checkout main
  commit id: "continue dev"
```

## Documentation Versioning Strategy

### Major Version Documentation Only

Following Docusaurus best practices, we maintain versioned documentation only for major versions (e.g., `2406.x`, `2412.x`, `2506.x`). This approach:

- **Reduces build complexity**: Each documentation version increases build time and bundle size
- **Simplifies maintenance**: Fewer versions to keep updated and consistent
- **Focuses on significant changes**: Major versions typically introduce substantial changes that warrant separate documentation

### Documentation Update Process

- **All documentation updates happen on `main`**: Whether fixing typos, updating procedures for new approvals (like `2406.1.0`), or adding new features, all changes must be made on the main branch.

- **Release branches have static documentation**: Documentation sources on `release/` branches (e.g., `release/2406.0`, `release/2412.0`) are not maintained after creation. They serve only for building the specific version releases.

- **Versioned snapshots before major releases**: Before creating a new major release branch, a documentation version snapshot is created on main. This captures the documentation state for that major version.

- **GitHub Pages deployment from `main` only**: The `gh-pages` branch is updated exclusively from the main branch, which contains all version snapshots and serves as the single source of truth for documentation deployment.

### Benefits for Developers

This workflow ensures that:

- Documentation improvements benefit all relevant versions
- No need to cherry-pick documentation fixes across multiple branches
- Clear separation between code releases and documentation maintenance
- Consistent documentation experience across all deployed versions
