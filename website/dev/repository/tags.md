The structure of tags is as follows:

v<CMCC Version>-<GlobalLink Workspace Version>
```

Thus, `v2412.0.0-1` signals compatibility with CMCC v12.2412.0.0 and is the
first approved version for usage with GlobalLink workspace. `v2412.0.0-1` is a
patch version for version `v2412.0.0-1`, which is based on the same CMCC
version, but for example contains bug fixes.
