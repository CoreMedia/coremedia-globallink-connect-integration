        <p>
        When using <code>docusaurus serve</code> (after
        <code>docusaurus build</code>), HTML file links cannot be found â€“ but
        you could strip the additional <code>*.html</code> from the URL to see,
        that it is actually available. Similar for
        <code>docusaurus start</code>, the links won't work, but in addition to
        that are not served at all.
        </p><p>
        This is due to limitations of the <code>transformLinks</code> plugin,
        that ignores HTML files.
        </p><p>
        <strong>Will work when deployed:</strong>
        As soon as deployed to GitHub pages, these links will work.
