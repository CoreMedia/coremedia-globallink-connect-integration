## Scenarios

1. [Contract Test](#scenario-contract-test)
2. [Happy Path](#scenario-happy-path)
3. [Cancellation](#scenario-cancellation)
4. [Error Handling](#scenario-error-handling)
5. [XLIFF Import Error Handling](#scenario-xliff-import-error-handling)

## Scenario: Contract Test

Especially on updates of `gcc-restclient` you should run the half-automatic
test `DefaultGCExchangeFacadeContractTest`. Read the JavaDoc to know how to
configure and run the test. 
Lately, when using the automatic workflow, the submission is not marked as 
`DELIVERED` anymore. This is why the `translateXliff` test fails. It seems to 
work with the manual workflow though.

## Scenario: Happy Path

1. Login as Rick C.
2. Open the GlobalLinkSettings `/Settings/Options/Settings/GlobalLink`
    1. type should not be set to “mock”
    2. dayOffsetForDueDate should be set to 20
    3. Credentials for gcc should be entered (automatic workflow key)
3. Choose an article and drag it into the “Localization Workflows” drop area
    1. A StartTranslation window should pop up
    2. There should be no warnings or errors
    3. The Due Date should be set to the current dateTime plus 20 days
4. Click “Start”
    1. The dialog should close without any error
    2. In the “pending” area from “Localization Workflows” the process should pop up
5. The workflow can be tracked in the “pending” area
    1. The status, submissionID, dueDate are set correctly
    2. As long as the Workflow is in “pending” the variable “Completed Locales” displays “0 Locales”
6. Wait for the workflow to be finished
    1. The Workflow should disappear from the “pending” area and appear on the “inbox” list
7. Select the Workflow in your “inbox” list
    1. The “Status” variable should display “Delivered”
    2. The “Completed Locales” variable should display the target locales of the workflow
    3. When clicking on the translated content, it opens in the comparison view to its master content
    4. The text should be pseudo translated
8. Click “Accept Task”
9. Choose “Finish Content Localization”
    1. The workflow should disappear from the “inbox”
    2. The workflow should appear in “Finished”

1. Login as Rick C.
2. Open the GlobalLinkSettings `/Settings/Options/Settings/GlobalLink`
    1. type should not be set to “mock”
    2. dayOffsetForDueDate should be set to 20
    3. Credentials for gcc should be entered (manual workflow key)
3. Choose an article and drag it into the “Localization Workflows” drop area

    3. The “X” should not be displayed in the header bar anymore
    4. The workflow should disappear in the “pending” list after some time
8. Depending on timing there might be a “Review Cancellation” Task in your inbox or the workflow will directly be cancelled
9. Confirm the “Review Cancellation” Task or wait for the workflow to appear in the “Finished” area
10. Open the “Finished” area
    1. The workflow should appear here
    2. The “Status” variable should display “Cancelled”
    3. The icon should mark the workflow as cancelled (little “x” on the bottom right)
