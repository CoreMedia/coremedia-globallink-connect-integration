## Scenarios

1. [Contract Test](#scenario-contract-test)
2. [Happy Path](#scenario-happy-path)
3. [Cancellation](#scenario-cancellation)
4. [Error Handling](#scenario-error-handling)
5. [XLIFF Import Error Handling](#scenario-xliff-import-error-handling)

## Prepare

For quicker test feedback set the following integer parameters in the 
GlobalLink-Settings `/Settings/Options/Settings/GlobalLink`

* sendTranslationRequestRetryDelay -> 60
* downloadTranslationRetryDelay -> 60
* cancelTranslationRetryDelay -> 60
* retryCommunicationErrors -> 1

## Scenario: Contract Test

Especially on updates of `gcc-restclient` you should run the half-automatic
test `DefaultGCExchangeFacadeContractTest`. Read the JavaDoc to know how to
configure and run the test. 
Lately, when using the automatic workflow, the submission is not marked as 
`DELIVERED` anymore. This is why the `translateXliff` test fails. It seems to 
work with the manual workflow though.

In order run the test you need to create a file with the name [.gcc.properties](example.gcc.properties.txt) in your user 
home folder

## Scenario: Happy Path

1. Login as Rick C.
2. Open the GlobalLinkSettings `/Settings/Options/Settings/GlobalLink`
    1. type should not be set to “mock”
    2. dayOffsetForDueDate should be set to 20
    3. Credentials for gcc should be entered (automatic workflow key)
3. Choose an article and drag it into the “Localization Workflows” drop area
    1. A StartTranslation window should pop up
    2. There should be no warnings or errors
    3. The Due Date should be set to the current dateTime plus 20 days
4. Click “Start”
    1. The dialog should close without any error
    2. In the "Running" area from “Localization Workflows” the process should 
       pop up
2. Double-Click on the Workflow to open it the Workflow App
3. The workflow can be tracked in the detail view in the Workflow App
    1. After some time the Status, Submission ID, Due Date are shown
    2. As long as the Workflow is in "Running" the variable “Completed Locales”
       displays “0 Locales”
6. Wait for the workflow to be finished
    1. The Workflow should disappear from the "Running" workflows in the Workflow 
       App and appear on the “Open” list.
    2. In the Content App the Workflow should now also be shown in the Inbox.
7. Select the Workflow in your “Open” list in the Workflow App
    1. The “Status” variable should display “Delivered”
    2. The “Completed Locales” variable should display the target locales of 
       the workflow
    3. When clicking on the translated content, it opens in the comparison view 
       to its master content in the Content App
    4. The text should be pseudo translated
8. Click “Accept Task” in the Workflow App and then "Next Step" -> 
   “Finish Content Localization”
    1. The workflow should disappear from “Open”
    2. The workflow should appear in “Closed”

2. Open the GlobalLinkSettings `/Settings/Options/Settings/GlobalLink`
    1. type should not be set to “mock”
    2. dayOffsetForDueDate should be set to 20
    3. Credentials for gcc should be entered (manual workflow key)
3. Choose an article and drag it into the “Localization Workflows” drop area

    1. A “X” should be activated in the header bar
    2. Multi-selection is possible. If you select a "normal" and a GlobalLink 
       workflow, the button remains deactivated. It is also  possible to select and 
       cancel multiple GlobalLink workflows at once.
6. Press the “X”
    1. A dialog should pop
7. Confirm the dialog
    1. The Dialog should close
    2. The icon of the workflow should change (now it has a little “x” on the 
   bottom right)
    3. The “X” should appear disabled in the header bar 
    4. The workflow should disappear in the "Running" list after some time
8. Depending on timing there might be a “Review Cancelation” task or a "Handle
   Cancelation Error" task in your open workflows. Or, the workflow will be 
   directly canceled, if the workflow at GlobalLink completed in the meantime.
9. In case of the “Handle Cancelation Error” Task, try out "Continue 
   translation" or "Abort and rollback without canceling at GlobalLink.".
10. After regularly reviewing the cancelation open the "Closed" list in the
    Workflow App.
    1. The workflow should appear here
    2. The “Status” variable should display “Canceled” (not sure why but the
       automatic workflow shows "Delivered")
    3. The icon should mark the workflow as canceled (little “x” on the 
       bottom right)
12. Login to the GlobalLink dashboard and the Project Director and verify that
    the workflow appears as "Canceled" here as well.
