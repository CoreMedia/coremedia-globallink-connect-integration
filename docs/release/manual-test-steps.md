## Scenarios

1. [Contract Test](#scenario-contract-test)
2. [Happy Path](#scenario-happy-path)
3. [Submitter and Instructions](#scenario-submitter-and-instructions)
4. [Cancellation](#scenario-cancelation)
5. [Error Handling](#scenario-error-handling)
6. [XLIFF Import Error Handling](#scenario-xliff-import-error-handling)

## Prepare

For quicker test feedback set the following integer parameters in the
GlobalLink-Settings `/Settings/Options/Settings/Translation Services/GlobalLink`

* sendTranslationRequestRetryDelay -> 60
* downloadTranslationRetryDelay -> 60
* cancelTranslationRetryDelay -> 60
* retryCommunicationErrors -> 1

## Scenario: Contract Test

Especially on updates of `gcc-restclient` you should run the half-automatic
test `DefaultGCExchangeFacadeContractTest`. Read the JavaDoc to know how to
configure and run the test.
Lately, when using the automatic workflow, the submission is not marked as
`DELIVERED` anymore. This is why the `translateXliff` test fails. It seems to
work with the manual workflow though.

In order run the test you need to create a file with the name
[.gcc.properties](example.gcc.properties.txt) in your user
home folder

## Scenario: Happy Path

### Cancelation Failure Handling

1. Log in as **Rick C**. Required to use Rick C here, as Adam, for example, will
   not be able to do the multi-selection test, as local translations will appear
   in "Open" section for Adam.
2. Open the GlobalLink
   settings `/Settings/Options/Settings/Translation Services/GlobalLink`
    1. _type_ is set to “default”
    2. Credentials for gcc are entered (**manual** workflow key)

   drop area
    1. A window _Localization Workflow_ should pop up
    2. There should be no warnings or errors
4. Click “Start”
    1. The dialog should close without any error
    2. A new workflow process should pop up in the "Running" area of Control
       Room's “Localization Workflows”
5. Repeat workflow creation twice, once with a "Translation" workflow and once
   with a "Translation with GlobalLink" workflow
6. Open the "Running" area of Control Room's “Localization Workflows”
    1. An “X” should be activated in the header bar, if a "Translation with
       GlobalLink" workflow is selected
    2. An “X” should be activated in the header bar, if two "Translation with
       GlobalLink" workflows are selected (multi-selection)
    3. No “X” should be activated in the header bar, if a "Translation"
       workflow is selected
    4. No “X” should be activated in the header bar, if a "Translation"
       workflow and a "Translation with GlobalLink" workflow are selected
       (multi-selection)
7. Open the "Running" section in Workflow App.
    1. “X Cancel” should be available in three-dot-menu, if a "Translation with
       GlobalLink" workflow is selected
    2. “X Cancel” should be available in three-dot-menu, if two "Translation
       with GlobalLink" workflows are selected (multi-selection)
    3. “X Cancel” should **not** be available in three-dot-menu, if a
       "Translation" workflow is selected
    4. “X Cancel” should **not** be available in three-dot-menu, if a
       "Translation" workflow and a "Translation with GlobalLink" workflow are
       selected (multi-selection)
8. **Break it:** Change, for example `globalLink.key` to some invalid value
   like adding a `-` (minus) as first character. This will cause subsequent
   calls to GlobalLink to fail. Note, that "speed now matters", thus quickly
   proceed with the next step, as otherwise the communication error may cause
   other effects.
9. Select both "Translation with GlobalLink" workflows and click the “X”
   (either in Workflow App or Control Room, as you like)
    1. A dialog should pop
10. Confirm the dialog

    2. The “X” should appear disabled in the header bar
    3. in the _Workflow App_, the workflows' icons should change (now they have
       a little “x” on the bottom right)
    4. The workflows should disappear from the "Running" list after some time
       (until then the status in _Workflow App_'s overview will be
       "CancelTranslation")
    5. Field "Current Task" in _Workflow App_'s detail view should
       show "Cancelation Error".

    2. Click "Abort and rollback without canceling at GlobalLink" and open the
       target site's document
        1. The document should remain in its previous version
    3. Go back to the _Workflow App_ overview
        1. The workflow should be moved from the "Running" to the "Closed" list
