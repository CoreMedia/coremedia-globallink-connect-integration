Changelog
================================================================================

2004
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Main Changes

* Updated to CoreMedia Content Cloud 10.2004.

* Updated `ActionTestBaseConfiguration` to latest version of the 
  `TranslatablePredicate` interface.

* Removed `translatableExpressions` configuration from  
  `TranslateGccConfiguration` which is now provided by the Blueprint's 
  multi-site module.
  
* Fixed ISSUE-12 to allow the usage of other setting types within the facade. 

  The interfaces of `GCExchangeFacadeProvider`, `GCExchangeFacadeSessionProvider`
  and all its subclasses have been updated to pass `Map<String, Object>` instead
  of `Map<String, String>`. If you have customized these classes or created your
  own subclasses, you will have to update them and make sure to cast the value
  of the settings in your implementation accordingly.
  
2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Main Changes

* Updated to CoreMedia Content Cloud 10.2001.

* Updated documentation with additional information on setup of 
  GlobalLink Connect Cloud.

1910
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Main Changes

* Updated to CoreMedia Content Cloud 10.1910.

* Update GCC from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0.

    * `com.coremedia.labs.translation.gcc.facade.GCSubmissionState`:
    
        Adapted to changes of `org.gs4tr.gcc.restclient.model.SubmissionStatus`:
        
        * `IN_PROGRESS`: Has been deprecated (for removal).
        
            The GCC API removed this state completely. You should not rely
            on this state anymore.
            
        * `CANCELLED`: Changes from artificial state to explicit state.
        
            Prior to 2.4.0 cancellation had been tracked as flag at
            a given state. With 2.4.0 the REST backend changes to this
            state explicitly.
            
            Implementation of `DefaultGCExchangeFacade.getSubmissionState`
            has been adopted accordingly.
            
        * `TRANSLATE`: Workaround for bug in 2.3.0 Java REST API removed.
        
            It maps to `SubmissionStatus` directly now.

### Bug Fixes

* #2 Direct cancellation of workflow might result into failure 
* #3 Submission name might be too long
* #5 Links to mock facade documentation in README broken

### Other Changes

* Introduced [GitHub Pages](https://coremedia.github.io/coremedia-globallink-connect-integration/).
* Migrated some documentation to GitHub Pages.
* Introduced `license-maven-plugin` to generate an overview of used third-party
    libraries and licenses.
* Removed PDF documents for third-party libraries. Has been replaced by
    [THIRD-PARTY.txt](docs/THIRD-PARTY.txt).

### General Notes

* The GCC REST Backend changes the response of supported locales to contain
    a trailing space, such as `"fr-FR "` rather than `"fr-FR"`. On parsing,
    you should ensure trimming the result first.
