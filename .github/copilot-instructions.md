This file contains instructions for GitHub Copilot (like for Copilot code
review). It is split up into several subsections located in
[instructions/](./instructions).

> Not all clients support instructions in `instructions/`. This central file
> is a try, so that they may still detect relevant locations to look for
> instructions. If it does not work, rely on those clients, that support
> multiple instruction files.
